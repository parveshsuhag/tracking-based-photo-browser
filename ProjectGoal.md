# Project Goals #

### Description: ###
Android mobile application for tracking the user's route(with the help of GPS), making it possible to take photos or record videos throughout the journey. The application then generates a map showing the visited route with the help of the images and videos taken.

  * We aim for a small, user friendly application which is easy to use and is intuitive.
  * No battery-killer.

## Compared to similar attempts ##

  * [TripJournal](http://www.trip-journal.com)
  * [PhotoRoute](http://photoroute.com) See [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXsIdWi0_pY)

**Our project will combine the two app's best features while
remaining simple, easily used and minimalistic:**
  * You can download maps uploaded by others (what TripJournal cannot do).
  * You can create and attach videos (unlike PhotoMap).
  * No useless functions like Facebook and Twitter sync, draining your battery!
